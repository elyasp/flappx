### Fullstack app that saves android app bundles in MySQL

##### Using react, node, styled-components, typescript, mysql, and an express router

#### To Run the App locally,

1. CD to root of app
2. npm install
3. npm run dev
4. Go to localhost:3000 in browser

TODO:

7. Fix Searchbar
8. Optional: To remove the console TypeErrors I'd have to create an interface for each value, also there where typechecking is not necessary (library tools)
